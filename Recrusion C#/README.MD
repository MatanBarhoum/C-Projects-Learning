# C# Recrusion

<img src="Example.gif">
<br>
Recrusion is a function that call itself. In order to make a recrusion we need a "exit" code. 
<br>
The exit code will be if (number == 0), but the return will be diffrent between calculations.
<br>
If we intend to divide or multiple - the return will be 1, because the final number * or / by 1 will always be the final number.
<br>
For example - 5*1 = 5 and 5/1 = 5 .
<br>
If we using adding or subtracting, the return will need to be 0, because 5+1 = 6 and 5-1 = 4, while 5+0 = 5 and 5-0 = 5.
<br>
Recrusion is very powerfull and saving time. instead of using for loop to increment or decrement a number, we just create a function that call itself.
